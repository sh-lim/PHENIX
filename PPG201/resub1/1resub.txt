Dear Lin,

We thank the referee for the positive evaluation of our manuscript and
for the useful suggestion to improve clarity. Below are our responses
to the referee concerns and some details on major changes. We also
include a latexdiff "other" file ppg201diff01.pdf, which explicitly
shows all changes made to text and captions.

We trust that the revised manuscript is now acceptable for publication
in Physical Review C.

Sincerely, Brant (for the PHENIX Collaboration)

================================ Responses to Referee concerns

R: The manuscript presents PHENIX's measurements of nuclear effects on
R: charged hadron production at forward and backward rapidity in p+Al
R: and p+Au collisions at 200 GeV. Certain features of suppression and
R: enhancement have been reported, based on the nuclear modification
R: factor, and comparisons have been made between data and theoretical
R: calculations. The measurements seem to be solid with various
R: systematic checks, and the presentation is clear and well written.

Thank you for your positive assessment of our manuscript and the useful
suggestion below to improve the presentation.

R: I only have one request about the interpretation of the data. Starting
R: from Fig 7(b), enhancement and/or suppression have been mentioned
R: frequently, but in some cases the systematic errors seem to prevent
R: a definite conclusion, such as Fig 7(b).
R:
R: So I would like to ask the authors to add the discussion of the
R: significance of enhancement or suppression in terms of sigma, for
R: figures 7 and later, so that the readers have a more objective
R: feeling.

We present many figures of the nuclear modification factors as a function of pT
and pseudo-rapidity in different centrality, and the nuclear modification
clearly depends on pT, pesudo-rapidity, and centrality. Therefore, we think it
will not be very information if add the significance of modification for every
figures. We have added the significance of modification in summary for central
p+Al and p+Au collisions where the modification is strongest among various
centrality bins. 



Thank you again for your positive review, comments, and suggestion to
improve our manuscript.
