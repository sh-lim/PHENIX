Report of the Referee -- CL10613/Adare
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The authors report on J/Psi meson yields obtained in p+p, p+Al, p+Au,
and He+Au collisions at the highest RHIC energy. The J/Psi are
detected in the rapidity intervals -2.2<eta<-1.2 and 1.2<eta<2.4, and
in the full pt range up to 6 GeV/c. The p+nucleus rapidity and pt
spectra are categorized in centrality intervals and normalized to the
spectra from p+p collisions resulting in rapidity and pt dependences
of the nuclear modification factors R_AB (for p+Al, p+Au, and He+Au
collisions). These factors play an important role in the
interpretation of collective effects observed in nucleus-nucleus
collisions. Therefore the presented data are an important contribution
to the field and should be published. PRC is an appropriate journal in
this respect.

I have, however, questions and remarks which the authors may address
before the manuscript is ready for publication. They are listed below
in random order.

1. In lines 136-141 the authors say that p+p, p+Al, p+Au, and He+Au
collisions have been studied .... also by Phenix. I guess that these
enumerations apply to the past. Please distinguish clearly between
previous data taking and analyses and the new data in this manuscript.

2. Refs [13,14] are cited but it is worth mentioning that they also
address the nuclear modification factor.

3. Many data points in pt distributions at and above 6 GeV/c (mostly
in the backward hemisphere) are significantly lower than the trend at
lower pt suggests (e.g. Fig.17) Are these jumps considered to be due
to physics?. This needs to be commented, Also please specify the bin
size, if it is not constant. Are there empty pt bins in the p+A data
(Figs. 26, 27, 28)? How did you compare p+p and p+A in those cases
where the bin sizes are different?

4. Something is missing in the 2nd sentence of the introduction. Do
you mean that the comparison of p+p with A+A (="hot nuclear matter")
is hampered by cold nuclear matter effects.

5. Starting in line 212 it reads: "The events considered here are
triggered by the dimuon trigger". But N_evt in equation 3 is probably
obtained from the MB event ensemble. Is the (+- 30 cm) primary vertex
cut also used for the MB events? Is N_evt in equation 3 corrected for
the MB trigger efficiency given in line 201?

6. Line 220: do the "details of dimuon selection" in [39,40] include
track cut parameter tuning?

7. Line 254: What is the range of efficiency changes with beam
intensity?

8. Line 258: What is meant by "full" J/Psi events? J/Psi decays into
mu-mu?

9. Line 259: with "Pythia event" you probably mean "Pythia J/Psi
decay".

10. Fig.3: What are the approximate fractions of reconstruction and
acceptance efficiencies? This relevant, because acceptance losses can
be determined with high precision whereas reconstruction efficiency
determination is more involved. Are these efficiencies centrality
dependent? If so, please give the range.

11. In line 176 the dimuon acceptance is specified as 1.2<|eta|<2.4
whereas everywhere else it is 1.2<|y|<2.2.

12. The sentence in line 182 seems to give only part of the argument.
Why does it hurt to reduce acceptance? Maybe the efficiency would go
up, if the FVTX information is used?

13. Line 256: J/Psi decays into dimuons ..

14. In line 279 Type A uncertainties are called random ...
uncertainties. Are these the same as the uncorrelated uncertainties in
line 343? What Type (A,B,C?) are the uncertainties of the BBC
efficiencies (in Table 1)? The reader will appreciate, if the
statistical and different kinds of systematic errors are uniquely
categorized and labeled.

15. Line 342: should "because" be rather "since"?? And "J/Psi
invariant yield per minimum bias collision".

16. Line 347: ... well understood in p+p interactions.

17. Figs. 8,14 are only mentioned but not commented in the text.

18. Line 381: "tighter" than what?

19. Line 383: energy scale dependence of what? Isn't mu_0 the
transverse mass?

20. Lines 389,390: please give figure numbers.

21. Line 415: "curves" are NOT "transport models"

22. Lines 424, 425: Please quantify the "weak" and "strong"
modifications mentioned here.

23. In the line count gap between 425,426: remaking => repeating

24. Lines 426,427: It is not obvious that the ratio in the backward
hemisphere is less than unity with 90% probability. In Fig.17 the
uncertainties for negative rapidities are given as "Fit: 0.89 ±
0.03(stats.) ±0.08(syst.)" instead of 0.05 for the systematic error in
the text. Please clarify and eventually modify the conclusion (also in
the summary). In fact the low value of the ratio is probably due
entirely to the first and last points of the pt spectrum. Maybe their
errors are underestimated? Please comment the large jumps of these
points.

25. Line 429: ...Fig.18 for the three systems p+Al, p+Au, He3+Au.

26. Line 433: "effect of the transport model" is a shortcut. I suggest
"result of transport model calculations". Also, please quantify the
"underprediction" of the suppression.

27. It may help future comparison with theory, if basic data would be
made available as numbers in tables. This is especially true for data
shown in plots with logarithmic scales (in the appendix).

28. In Figs.4, 8 the last bin is missing in the ratio (out of scale).

29. Figs 23 , 24, 25 have wrong labels on the vertical scale.

30. The caption of Fig.2 reads: Invariant mass distributions of
unlike-sign and like-sign dimuons in MB p+p and p+Au collisions in the
south muon arm. In section III.A "the events are from a dimuon
trigger"???? Are the data points in Fig.2 corrected for acceptance?
